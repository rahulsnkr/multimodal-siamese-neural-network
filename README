## Multimodal Siamese Neural Network

One Shot Learning for Multimodal Biometric System using Siamese Convolutional Neural Networks

### About

The model accepts a pair of inputs, where each input consists of an RGB image of a face, and a grayscale image of the signature, and gives out a similarity score that tells us whether the input pair belongs to the same source or not.

### Evaluation Results

As can be seen above, the loss curve converges during training fairly quickly and remains stable.

![alt text](eval.png "Evaluation")

Our model is evaluated against two naive approaches, i.e. random guessing and nearest neighbour clustering. As the number of images increase in the support set, our model greatly outperforms the naive methods, indicating that the model is working as expected. 

![alt text](test.png "Test")

We tested our model on face-signature pairs that it hasn't seen before. The results are as shown above. We conclude that our model is working as expected.
